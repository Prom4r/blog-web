TECHNOLOGIES

    I have used the following technologies to solve problems in the above project:
    - springboot
    - angular5
    - database h2
    - lombok
    - junit
    - mockito
    - maven ...

Description
================================================================================
On the backendâ€™s side, spring boot has been used because, in my opinion, this is the best way to build web service application. It provides many helpfull practical solutions. I have decided to use h2 database because it is sufficient for this project.

When it comes to frontend, I have used angular 5, for education properties because I never used it before.
